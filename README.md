# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

Hello everyone!

My name is Carley Maupin, and this summer I am working on a research project at Wash U in St. Louis! So far I am having a great time, and I cannot wait to learn more!

Peace,

C xoxo
